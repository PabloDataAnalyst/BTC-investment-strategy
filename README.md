## 🎯 Goal

Evaluate how a Bitcoin investment strategy based on trends performs under real market conditions, using a clear and professional analytics workflow.

This project aims to:

- Measure the strategy’s **returns, stability, and risk profile**.  
- Compare it against **Bitcoin buy-and-hold** and **global equities**.  
- Analyze **drawdowns, volatility**, and **rolling performance**.  
- Test robustness through **Monte Carlo simulations**.  
- Present insights in an **executive-friendly Power BI dashboard**.

---

## 📊 Results

- The strategy achieves a **better risk–return profile** than BTC buy & hold in the period analyzed, especially during **clear trending moments**.  
- Performance **weakens in sideways periods**, showing lower operational efficiency.
- Drawdown analysis indicates a **controlled downside** relative to the asset’s high volatility.  
- The equity curve shows **consistent behavior**, though sensitive to market structure.  
- **Monte Carlo stress testing** shows a 5% worst-case annual return of **–2.6%**, and a 1% extreme tail of **–20.1%**, indicating controlled downside risk under the fixed 5% risk-per-trade rule.

📌 The focus of this project is to demonstrate a **professional quantitative analysis workflow**, not to validate the strategy as a commercial product.

## ⚙️ Process

### 1. Data Sources

**Backtest CSV (own data)**  
- Real dataset generated from the strategy.  
- Includes: trade id, type of operation, stoploss pct, date, returns, iv(variation index, used for equity curve calculation and Monte Carlo Stress Test).  
- For **educational/analytical use only**.

**Yahoo Finance – Benchmarks**  
- BTC-USD  
- Additional Benchmark Data (not displayed in dashboard):  
    - Downloaded S&P500, NASDAQ100, MSCI World from Yahoo Finance  
    - Used for KPI comparison and internal validation of methodology

### 2. Processing Pipeline (R)

**Data Loading & Cleaning**
- Date normalization
- NA cleaning
- Standardization of return formats
- Temporal alignment across datasets

**Equity Curve Construction**
- Daily return
- Cumulative product
- High watermark
- Drawdown & Max Drawdown

**Performance KPIs**
- Total Return
- CAGR
- Annualized volatility
- Sharpe & Sortino
- Profit Factor
- Recovery ratio

**Risk Metrics**
- Max Drawdown
- Ulcer Index
- Ulcer Performance Index (UPI)
- Winning / losing streaks
- Volatility clustering

**Rolling Metrics (key for senior level)**
- Rolling Sharpe
- Rolling volatility
- Rolling drawdown

**Monte Carlo Stress Test**
- Resampling of `iv` returns
- 5000 simulated paths
- Tail risk evaluation (1% and 5% quantiles)

**Benchmark Integration**
- Base 100 equity curves
- Equivalent KPIs for S&P500 / BTC
- Direct equity curve comparison (only BTC used in dashboard)

### 3. Output Layer

- `kpis.csv`  
- `benchmark_kpis.csv`  
- `btc_eq_full.csv`  
- `strategy_eq_full.csv`  
- `strategy_results_full.csv`  
- Final export to Power BI

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **R** → quantitative processing, KPIs, simulations  
- **Excel** → quick validations, ad hoc monthly calculations  
- **Power BI** (Power Query + DAX) → final modeling, executive visualization  

---

## 📉 Limitations

- One-year analysis period, limited but sufficient to assess stability and methodology.  
- Does not include commissions, slippage, or execution costs.  
- Strategy has a low number of trades due to its conservative nature.  
- Dataset is specific → not generalizable to all market conditions.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Incorporate commissions and slippage  
- Multi-period analysis (2020–2024)  
- Testing by market regimes (trending, sideways, high volatility)  
- Out-of-sample testing and walk-forward  
- Higher temporal granularity (4h / 1h)  
- Risk sensitivity testing (3% / 5% / 7%)
